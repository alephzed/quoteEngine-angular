#ALLO! ALLO! LET'S SCAFFOLD A WEB APP

**By Addy Osmani, James Cryer & Pearl Chen with Annotation Tutorial by Codio**

In this code lab, you build a fully functional application using Yeoman and AngularJS. The sample app provides a brief look at some Yeoman, Grunt and Bower features. 

Take a look at the image below. You can see the Codio IDE with 

- the step-by-step tutorial content in the right hand panel 
- your terminal and code windows on the left

So you can work your way through the tutorial really easily without having to switch windows or tabs.
