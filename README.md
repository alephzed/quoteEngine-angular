#ALLO! ALLO! LET'S SCAFFOLD A WEB APP

**By Addy Osmani, James Cryer & Pearl Chen with Annotation Tutorial by Codio**

In this code lab, you build a fully functional application using Yeoman and AngularJS. The sample app provides a brief look at some Yeoman, Grunt and Bower features. 

##IF YOU'VE COME FROM YEOMAN.IO SITE

**WARNING** : if you clicked in the yeoman.io site to get here, you will likely not have a Codio account, so you should sign up (select the 'Try Now' option). When completed you will be returned to the Codio dashboard and select the app to continue.
